# x3
x3 (lossless audio compression) packing and unpacking.

This is a Java implementation of the algorithms developed by Mark Johnson and described in his paper M. Johnson, J. Partan, and T. Hurst, ‘Low complexity lossless compression of underwater sound recordings’, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 133, no. 3, pp. 1387–1398, 2013. https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4776206
